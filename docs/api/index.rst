Hoodie API Guide
================

The Hoodie Guide is a special version of the API documentation for
beginners, intermediates, and advanced programmers who want to have a
nicely documented API with additional information and code examples. For
now, it covers the core client API.

1. The Hoodie Client API
------------------------

This library, commonly called **Hoodie Client**, is what you'll be
working with on the client side. It consists of:

-  `The Hoodie API </camp/techdocs/api/client/hoodie.html>`__, which has
   a couple of useful helpers
-  `The account API </camp/techdocs/api/client/hoodie.account.html>`__,
   which lets you do user authentication, such as signing users up, in
   and out
-  `The store API </camp/techdocs/api/client/hoodie.store.html>`__,
   which provides means to store and retrieve data for each individial
   user
-  `The connectionStatus
   API </camp/techdocs/api/client/hoodie.connection-status.html>`__,
   which provides helpers for connectivity.
-  `The log API </camp/techdocs/api/client/hoodie.log.html>`__, which
   provides a nice API for logging all the things
